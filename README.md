# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 11

---

Write a program to solve the following problems. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

In **shapes.py**, classes for Point and Circle have been defined. Also, a function to input a point from the user and input a circle from the user have been provided (with sample usage). Create functions that compute the following quantities. Show that they work by inputting the necessary points and circles and outputting the results (descriptively).

    - Write a function that takes in two points and returns the distance between the two points.
    - Write a function that takes in two points and returns the slope of the line between the two points.
    - Write a function that takes in a circle and returns its circumference.
    - Write a function that takes in a circle and returns its area.
    - Write a function that takes in a point and a circle and returns True if the point is inside the circle (or on the edge), False if the point is outside the circle.

***Bonus*** Write a function that takes in three points and returns True if the points are collinear and False if they are not collinear.

*Note: This bonus will be helpful for the bonus to homework 8 as well.*
